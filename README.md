# Bootstrap Mock-up

After learning the basics of HTML5 and CSS3, our trainers at Re:Coded gave us a task of exploring bootstrap along with creating the mock-up image of what they have given us, the result was this simple layout following semantic rules with no integrations required. It was the beginning of a bigger and brighter journey to come.
